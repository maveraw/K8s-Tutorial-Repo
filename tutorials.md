## [📌 Kubernetes Basics (Beginner Level)](#1)

### Understanding Kubernetes
Before diving into setting up and using Kubernetes, it's crucial to understand what Kubernetes is, why we need it, and how its architecture works.

### What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

 Key Features of Kubernetes:
- Automated Deployment & Scaling – No need to manually start/stop containers.
- Self-Healing – Kubernetes replaces failed containers automatically.
- Load Balancing & Service Discovery – Distributes traffic across running instances.
- Storage Orchestration – Manages storage volumes for stateful applications.
- Configuration & Secrets Management – Securely manages sensitive application data.
- Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Support – Runs on AWS, GCP, Azure, or even on-premise.

### Why Do We Need Kubernetes?
Before Kubernetes, developers used traditional methods of deploying applications on servers, which were inefficient and prone to scalability and reliability issues.

Initially, virtual machines (VMs) were used, but they were heavy and slow. Then, containers (like Docker) became popular, but managing multiple containers manually became complex. Kubernetes was created to automate this process, making it easier to manage containerized applications at scale.

### Kubernetes Architecture Overview
Kubernetes follows a master-worker architecture, consisting of multiple components:

🛠️ Control Plane (Master Node)
The Control Plane is responsible for managing the entire cluster and includes:

API Server (kube-apiserver) – The central component that exposes Kubernetes APIs to users and tools like kubectl.
Scheduler (kube-scheduler) – Assigns workloads (Pods) to worker nodes based on resource availability.
Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager) – Ensures the desired state of the cluster (e.g., scaling, pod replication).
etcd – A distributed key-value store that keeps cluster configuration and state.

### Worker Nodes (Compute Nodes)
Worker nodes run applications inside containers and communicate with the control plane. Each node has:

- Kubelet – The agent that communicates with the master and runs the containers.
- Container Runtime (Docker/Containerd/CRI-O) – Runs the containers inside the pods.
- Kube Proxy – Handles network communication between pods and services.

### Key Kubernetes Concepts

Concept	Description
Pod 🟢	The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. Contains one or more containers.
Deployment 📦	Manages replica sets and ensures pods run consistently.
Service 🔗	Exposes a set of pods to the network (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).
ConfigMap 🛠️	Stores configuration data for applications.
Secret 🔑	Stores sensitive data like API keys and passwords.
Persistent Volume (PV) 🗄️	Provides storage for stateful applications.

### Setting Up Kubernetes
- Install prerequisites (Docker, `kubectl`, Minikube)
- Start a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube
- Basic `kubectl` commands:
  ```sh
  kubectl cluster-info
  kubectl get nodes
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
  ```

### Deploying Applications in Kubernetes
- Create a simple deployment:
  ```sh
  kubectl create deployment myapp --image=nginx
  ```
- Scale deployments:
  ```sh
  kubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas=3
  ```
- Expose deployment using a service:
  ```sh
  kubectl expose deployment myapp --type=NodePort --port=80
  ```

### Understanding Services in Kubernetes
- Service types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName
- How to access applications inside/outside the cluster
- Create a LoadBalancer service:
  ```sh
  kubectl expose deployment myapp --type=LoadBalancer --port=80
  ```

### Configuring Volumes and ConfigMaps
- Using Persistent Volumes (PVs) & Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)
- ConfigMaps & Secrets:
  ```sh
  kubectl create configmap app-config --from-literal=APP_ENV=production
  ```

- Difference between Stateless vs. Stateful applications
- Deploying StatefulSets (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Managing Persistent Storage

### Kubernetes Networking
- Understanding CNI (Container Networking Interface)
- Kubernetes Service Discovery & DNS
- Ingress controllers and Ingress rules:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: myapp-ingress
  spec:
    rules:
    - host: myapp.local
      http:
        paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
          backend:
            service:
              name: myapp
              port:
                number: 80
  ```

### Kubernetes Security Basics
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Securing Secrets & ConfigMaps
- Pod Security Policies
- Service Accounts

### Helm & Kubernetes Package Management
- Introduction to Helm charts
- Installing Helm & creating a Helm chart
- Deploying applications using Helm:
  ```sh
  helm install myapp ./mychart
  ```

  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-web
  spec:
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: web
    policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    ingress:
    - from:
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: backend
  ```
